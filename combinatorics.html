                    Ordered draw without replacement

                <p>
                    Ordered draw without replacement immediately implies that the number of draws (\(k\)) has to be smaller or equal to the number of items (\(n\)) drawn.
                    You realize in the figure above that after \(k\) draws you have \(n-(k-1)\) choices and after the draw you have \(n-k\) balls left.
                    This means that the total number of combinations you can make is:
                    <p>                    
                        \(n \cdot (n-1) \cdots (n-(k-1)) = \frac{n \cdot (n-1) \cdots (n-(k-1)) \cdot (n-k) \cdots 2 \cdot 1}{(n-k) \cdot (n-k-1) \cdots 2 \cdot 1} \\
                        = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \).
                    </p>
                    This means for the special case, where \(k=n\): \(n!\)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Unordered Draw without replacement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here it is very important to note that we only count unique combinations of balls, which means that for \(k=n\) there is only <em>one</em> combination.
                    For \(k\) draws of balls there are exactly \(k \cdot (k-1) \cdots 2 \cdot 1 = k!\) permutations, which is exactly the logic that applies to the <em>ordered draw without replacement</em><div class=""></div>
                    This means that we need to divide the formula for the ordered draw by \(k!\) to obtain the formula for the unordered case:
                    <p>
                        \(\frac{n!}{k!\cdot (n-k)!} := \binom{n}{k}\).
                    </p>
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Draws with replacement
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Here the same item can be drawn multiple times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Ordered Draw with replacement 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This case is rather simple, as in every draw n balls are available and so the amount of different draws is:
                    <p>
                        \(n^k\).
                    </p>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Unordered Draw with replacement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In case the draw is unordered, one can obtain a formula by using an analogy (which essentially tries to refer to the case without replacement), which  I want to explain with the help of the following figure:

                    Imagine you have k buckets to place your marbles into and you also have at least k objects of each kind of marble.
                    As the order does not count, you can imagine that you have a slider or separator for each kind of marble: for \(n\) marbles you need \(n-1\) separations.
                    Now each unique arrangement will have different slider positions. In principle, each slider has k positions to select from. Here comes the crux: As multiple sliders can occupy the same position, the positions you draw from equals the number of buckets plus the number of sliders = \(k+(n-1)\). We have to place \(n-1\) sliders, therefore the number of arrangements are:
                    <p>
                        \(\binom{k+(n-1)}{n-1} = \binom{k+(n-1)}{k}\).
